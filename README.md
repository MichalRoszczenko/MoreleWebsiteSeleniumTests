# Selenium website store tests

### ‚úèÔ∏è Overwiev
The repository contains a set of Selenium tests designed to check and test the functionality of the online store.

The tests focus on functionalities such as filtering, sorting and adding products to the cart. Tests are performed on graphics cards.

Some important test cases that focused on payment methods or delivery methods were intentionally omitted.
This is due to limitations associated with the testing environment.
